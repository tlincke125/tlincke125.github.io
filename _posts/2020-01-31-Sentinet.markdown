### The Project
We wrote a ROS knock off for fun called sentinet, a faster but more configurable asynchronous message passing library that works over bluetooth, serial, wifi and inproc. This robot is being driven by a wii remote (We wrote the communication protocol, but used wiiuse library to transmit bytes over bluetooth). The input message is being processed (low level automation) by a jetson TX2 in C++, then filtered to a microcontroller (teensy 3.6) using a serial communication and message marshalling library I wrote in C / C++ and sent to the wheels. The purpose of this project was not practical engineering design, it was mostly a learning process to write as much as we could from scratch.

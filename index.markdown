# Welcome
I'm an American Open Source Software Engineer and Applied Mathematics Student with an interest in nonlinear dynamics, chaos and flight control software. This website is a new project in the works. I would like to spend time blogging about the projects I'm working on; but unfortunately, I never blogged during my projects in the last couple of years so I will be spending some extra time writing about my previous projects - however, going forward into 2021, I hope to update this blog daily.

I am currently working on a project revisiting my Machine Learning library I worked on my freshman year "purify" the mathematics a bit as well as optimize the code for modern C++. I will keep each project as a single blog post - updating the post rather than adding a new post.

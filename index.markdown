# Welcome
I'm an American Open Source Software Engineer and Applied Mathematics Student with an interest in nonlinear dynamics, chaos and flight control software. 

# What to expect
I can't post every day because of school, but I will try to include one integral problem a day, and at least attempt to update one of my projects. 

# Integrals
I'm doing one quite challenging integral a day for a couple weeks. I get these integrals from random locations on the internet. I will never get a solution on an integral solver, I will make the solution as pure from my head as possible, therefore, you could expect to find mistakes. Sometimes, I will spend a while on an integral, then give up, but I will still try to write the attempted work and come back to them another day. If I get help online, I will mention that in the post.
